## Introduction

There was moment in my life that of performing a ritual of gathering my thoughts while therapeutically practicing dental hygiene came to an unexpected halt. My Philips sonicare stopped working after 2 years of usage. When this occurred, over the course of days, my thoughts turned into a dialogue of socratic questioning within myself, followed by inductive reasoning. These thoughts were amplified on having a stance of anti-consumerism where I resisted to replace this device without acquiring further knowledge on the possible causes of failure, and more importatnly solutions for this now, comatosed device. My curoisty became the catalyst that caused my research to begin.

## First Attempt

Disambling this device isn't exactly an easy task, as it requires pateince adequtei tools and tremendous force for this device. There is not a single screw, cover, cap, collet that I initially noticed for a point-of-attack on how to disassemble this device. In my first hour or so of research, I found that several people claim to have issues with batteraies dieing and needed a replacemnts. Thankfully there is good instructions online at toothbrush batteries on the procedure to replace it battery. This procedure invovles disassembling the device.

Taking a guess of the material of the device's body, perhaps its flexible PVC. Its defiantely flexiable, whic is good, because following the disassemby procedure requres deforming the bottom end of the body to form an almost circular profile to enable a probe-to-hook the inside of the cap. Once removed, the "tremedous force" I mentiond about is to dislodge the internal body from its external body. This required me to firmly grip the eternal body gradually apply my body weight over it while shaft is being pressed into a sacifial piece of wood laying on my table. Once dislodged, the internal body should slip out.

The internal body is quite immpressive and seems to be well engineered. Without retierating what has been mentioned in the analysis at xxxx.com, I did noticed something obvious and suspicious nearby the transisitor next to the 6 gold-colored circles, there was white residue that seemed to have come from it. It wasn't something that seemed to have been from manufacturing, or that seeped out of this tranisistor, but it seemed as if it exploded from it. And perhaps it did. This picture, along with the one above, has been taken after I cleaned the ciruit board with isotopic alocohol.

Engraved on this transitor are the letters 'TSC', which indicates that the manufacturor is 'Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation'. Since I suspected that this transistor was the culprit, I ordered replacements at Digikey and where the [datasheet](/assets/2020-05-15/TSM6963SD_D15.pdf) is also available. I purchased 5 of them, with anticipation of destorying some unintentionally during install, for less than $10 which includes devilerly.
