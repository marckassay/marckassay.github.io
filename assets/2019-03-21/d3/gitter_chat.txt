For anyone who can answer this, "Is it correct to say WebdriverIO wraps a Selenium client library"?

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 15:53
@marckassay not at all

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 15:53
https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/
This is a spec that defines the webdriver protocol
selenium and webdriverio both communicate with drivers via this protocol or the slowly being replaced jsonwp protocol

Marc Kassay @marckassay 15:59
@abjerstedt, Thanks! Yeah, I noticed in my project's lock file there was no reference to selenium-webdriver (JS) which surprised me since I was assuming it had to because of Appium's doc, "These libraries wrap standard Selenium client libraries to provide all the regular selenium commands dictated by the JSON Wire protocol..." - http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/appium-clients/index.html

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 15:59
appium does
but appium behaves like a driver
it exposes endpoints that wdio interactions with

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 16:00
so Webdriverio -> Appium -> UIAutomater2

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:00
Oh! Isn't WebdriverIO an Appium client?

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 16:01
no
We are a library that lets you interact with appium, or browser drivers

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:05
@abjerstedt thanks again! But what is the difference between a library and client in this context?

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 16:05
you could interact directly with appium if you wanted
by a series of web requests

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:10
Ok. We you mentioned, 'browser drivers' are you referring to, for instance, ChromeDriver (http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and not any libraries for it?

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 16:11
chromedriver is a binary

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 16:11
it automates the driver via exposing endpoints
and depending on what web requests are send to that endpoint
chromedriver then interacts with chrome
(same with the other browsers)

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:16
Ok. Would it be correct to say, "UIAutomater2 automates native requests where as ChromeDriver automates webview requests"?

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:18
Errr...that last question of mine....let me retract it.

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:25
@abjerstedt so this article isn't completely accurate? - http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/appium-clients/index.html

Adam Bjerstedt @abjerstedt 16:26
no its not
because we don't wrapper selenium

Marc Kassay @marckassay 16:27
@abjerstedt ok. Thanks.
